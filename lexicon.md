# Project Lexicon & Naming Guide

## üåé General Naming Principles

* Use **full dictionary words** (e.g., `position`, not `pos`).
* Use **namespacing by meaning**, not by implementation (e.g., `menuBar` not `menuUi`).
* Favor **verbs for actions**, **nouns for data**, and **adjectives for properties**.
* Prefer **consistency over brevity**.

## üß© Consistent Naming Templates

* **Constructors**: `new`
* **Queries**: `get<Property>`, `is<BooleanProperty>`
* **Updates**: `set<Property>`, `update`, `<verb><Noun>`
* **Events**: `on<Event>`, e.g. `onClick`, `onDoubleClick`
* **Transformations**: `to<Something>`, e.g. `toScreenCoordinates`
* **View renderers**: `view`
